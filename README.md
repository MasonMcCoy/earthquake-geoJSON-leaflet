# GeoJSON and Leaflet Earthquake Visualization

## Background

![1-Logo](static/Images/1-Logo.png)


This is a student project that uses the United States Geological Survey's publicly available data to visualize earthquakes around the world. This is meant to be an educative tool to allow the public to better interface with this information.


## Your Task

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

Your first task is to visualize an earthquake data set.

1. **Get your data set**

   ![3-Data](static/Images/3-Data.png)

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Data was used from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). This is geoJSON data.

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers reflect the magnitude and depth of each earthquake by their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

   * Popups are included that provide additional information about each earthquake when the marker is clicked.

   * A legend was created to provide context for the map data.

### Level 2: More Data

TO-DO:

* Plot a second data set on the map.

* Add a number of base maps to choose from, as well as two different data sets seperated into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to the map.
